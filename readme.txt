== Installation ==

<ul>
<li>Install your plugin by uploading it in your Wordpress site or install it directly from the Wordpress Plugin Browser.</li>
<li>Upload your logos to the Custom Post Type and add them to a carousel (category)</li>
<li>Copy the shortcode in your Wordpress site. No id specified will return all logos. You can also use the id 'default' for returning all logos. If you want to display a single carousel category, use the slug as the id. The shortcode looks like this <code>[logo-carousel id=default]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: You can't use a carousel category with a slug called 'default'.</p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I use the slug 'default' for my carousel? =

Because the slug 'default' is already used for displaying all the logos.

= Which browsers are supported? =

We tested this plugin with: Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10; Chrome; Safari; Firefox; Opera;
The grayscale effect does not work with some version of Internet Explorer.

= What are the server requirements? =
You need a server running PHP version 5.4 or newer. Older versions are not supported and may cause problems.

= I have problems with adding logo images =
When you are using a theme by TrueThemes or another theme which is not supporting featured images, or handles featured images in another way. You cannot use this plugin.
Please contact your theme developer.

= Why is the shortcode not working in widget areas? =
Add this code to your themes functions.php:
' add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode'); '

= Plugin doesn't work. jQuery not defined. =
You need a recent version of jQuery to make things work. Please make sure you are loading jQuery in the header of your theme.
